# Readme for the project
Hi! My name is Ellie, and this is my first ever website. This website is part of a project that will talk about what publishing means to me, how I want to publish, and the benefits to specific publishing such as traditional or self-publishing! I will also be reflecting on my experience with publishing the website itself!
