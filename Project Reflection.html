<h1>Project Reflection</h1>
<p>Publishing a website is no easy task. Learning to be a technical writer, the last thing I ever expected to do was learn how to code. Although I have found HTML fairly simple to use, one thing I really struggle with is adding photos. It seems like no matter how I try to format it, the photos either turn out or they don’t, and I have no idea why they don’t. Using github itself was really confusing to me at first. I have zero experience when it comes to coding or making a website. But once the files were uploaded it wasn’t so bad. If there’s one thing I have learned, its that this wasn’t easy. There are plenty of things that can go wrong and if you aren’t prepared for things to go wrong it can be incredibly frustrating. Things can go wrong with coding, uploading, and even the publishing itself. It can be even more frustrating when you don’t expect it to take very long to fix the mistake. Patience can be a very big thing when it comes to both coding and digitally publishing something, and it can take a lot of trial and error. I’m glad I am not a computer science major, but I also kind of enjoyed the actual coding for the website itself. I found it very interesting. I can kind of relate to their frustrations now, and I would recommend anyone try to code a website in HTML as well as publish it. You never know what you might learn about both the process, and yourself.
